 *     Rooted in Open Source CMS, Jahia’s Digital Industrialization paradigm is about
 *     streamlining Enterprise digital projects across channels to truly control
 *     time-to-market and TCO, project after project.

 *     marketing teams to collaboratively and iteratively build cutting-edge
 *     online business solutions.
 *     These, in turn, are securely and easily deployed as modules and apps,
 *     reusable across any digital projects, thanks to the Jahia Private App Store Software.
 *     Each solution provided by Jahia stems from this overarching vision:
 *     Digital Factory, Workspace Factory, Portal Factory and eCommerce Factory.
 *     Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland,
 *     Jahia Solutions Group has its North American headquarters in Washington DC,
 *     with offices in Chicago, Toronto and throughout Europe.
